 name 		  			| preprocessor ok	| codegen ok 				| remarks
 ared.c (newly added by us) 		| YES			| NO (pair, tofino) 			| a stateful node cannot be synthesized (logic too complex)
		  			| 			| 					| problematic expression: (p_gain*p_q_avg00)+(1-p_gain)*p_q_inst
 avq.c (domino)   			| YES			| NO (pair, tofino)	 		| stateful node too many inputs (3 stateless inputs to one node)  
 codel.c (domino)  			| - 			| - 					| REMOVED  (doesn't map in domino paper because of sqrt())
 ftp_monitoring.c (domino) 		| YES			| stateless timeout (pair)              | test pair, tofino in parallel mode on NYU machine

 hull.c (domino)		     	| YES			| NO (pair)				| too many stateless inputs to one stateful node
 majority.c  (newly added by us) 	| YES			| YES (pair, tofino), 1 stage	        | only synthesizable using pair/tofino since 
					|			|					|    requires two stateful regs in one ALU.
 majority2.c (newly added by us) 	| YES  			| YES (pair, tofino), 1 stage width 2   | width 2 since two stateful nodes aren't interfering
 majority3.c (newly added by us) 	| YES			| YES (pair, tofino), 1 stage width 3   | width 3, same as above
